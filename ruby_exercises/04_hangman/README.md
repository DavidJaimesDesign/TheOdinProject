##A command line Hangman game written in ruby.

###User Stories:

* You will be building a simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer, but a bit more advanced. If you're unfamiliar with how Hangman works, see Wikipedia.

* When a new game is started, your script should load in the dictionary and randomly select a word between 5 and 12 characters long for the secret word.

* You don't need to draw an actual stick figure (though you can if you want to!), but do display some sort of count so the player knows how many more incorrect guesses she has before the game ends. 

*You should also display which correct letters have already been chosen (and their position in the word, e.g. `_ r o g r a _ _ i n g`) and which incorrect letters have already been chosen.
